## Growth Mindset
>A person that has a growth mindset is someone that is willing to try new things even if they fail.  
They understand stand that failure is apart of the journey.  Those with growth mindset’s always are looking to improve themselves in every area of life….. 

&emsp;**Three Reminders to Stay in Growth Mindset** 
1. Always try to look at things with a positive perspective *(the glass half full)*
2.  REMEMBER EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON 
3. Get comfortable being uncomfortable (you can’t grow unless you get outside your bubble)
