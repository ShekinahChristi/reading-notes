## Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript
if we want to check the grade of every student in the class, we loop from 1 to that number. When the number of times is not known before hand, we use a "While" loop.
for (var  i:int = start_value; i < finish_value; i = i + by_count );
   {        
     do something
   }

 // example: sum numbers from 1 to 10
 var total:int = 0;
 for (var i:int=1; i<10; i++)
   {
     total = total + i;
