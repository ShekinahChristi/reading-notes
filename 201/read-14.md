rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element

## Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
In this example we have a 3D cube created using transforms. The parent container of the cube faces has transform-style: preserve-3d set on it by default, so it is transformed in the 3D space and you can see it as intended.

## How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
CSS transitions are generally best for simple from-to movements, while CSS animations are for more complex series of movements
