## Reading Notes Class 08

## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means

It takes a bunch of items which have different sizes and returns the best layout for those items.

## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis?

The main axis is set by the flex-direction property and if it that is row the main axis is row and vice versa for column. The cross axis runs in the opposite of the main axis, so if flex-direction is row then the cross axis is the column.

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
certain properties can reorder the visual display from how things are ordered in the HTML document. the row-reverse and column-reverse are examples of this.

## What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
Makes all children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much is available.

Makes all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.

## How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
It can help with creating a smooth process for making HTML easier, which can help with being a better web developer/engineer.
