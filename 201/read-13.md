Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

## Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
Web storage provides a way to store data locally on a user's device, even after the user closes the browser or navigates away from the website. This allows web applications to provide a seamless user experience without losing important data.

## What information should not be stored in local storage?
Personally Identifiable Information (PII), authentication tokens, user locations and API keys, etc., should never be stored in the local storage

## Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
localStorage can only store strings, so if you want to store other data types, you'll have to convert them to strings.
